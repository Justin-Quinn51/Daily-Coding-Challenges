// ES6 string addition

/*ES6 has introduced another way of joining strings. Your task is to find out what this is and write a function that will add two strings together, there must be a space between the two strings.

+ , .concat() & .join() will not be allowed in this exercise. I have also removed some other methods that can be used to cheat!

If one of the arguments is a number your code must coerce it into being a string.*/

// Solution

function joinStrings(string1, string2){
    return `${string1} ${string2}`
 }

// Simple Comparison? 

/*Write a function that will compare two values, one will be a number and one will be a string. Return true if they are the same character (regardless of their different data types) and return false if they are not.

To make this challange harder and to promp the challenger to read up about coercion I have disabled some of the built in methods including .toString(), .join(), .split(), parseInt and .Number(). */

// Solution

function add(a, b){
    return a == b
  }
